# Dream Explorer: Web-Based Knowledge Gardening System

## Introduction

Dream Explorer is a web-based implementation of Project Liminality, an innovative knowledge gardening system that revolutionizes the way we structure and interact with information. It transcends the traditional "Second Brain" paradigm by introducing the concept of an "InterBrain" - a dynamic, relational approach to organizing knowledge.

## Core Concepts

### Dream Nodes

The fundamental unit of Dream Explorer is the "Dream Node," which is represented by a Git repository. Dream Nodes can embody two primary concepts:

1. **Dreams**: Abstract ideas, concepts, or any form of knowledge.
2. **Dreamers**: Representations of people or peers.

This dual nature allows for a flexible and interconnected knowledge structure.

### Dream Talk and Dream Song

Each Dream Node consists of two main components:

- **Dream Talk**: A concise, symbolic representation of the idea (like a thumbnail or icon).
- **Dream Song**: A more elaborate explanation or exploration of the idea (possibly using lower-level Dream Talk), typically represented by the README file of the repository.

### The InterBrain

Dream Explorer structures knowledge based on social relationships and interactions, creating an "InterBrain." This approach allows users to organize information organically along the edges of their social relational field, transcending static, top-down categorization.

## Key Features

- **Git-Based Structure**: Utilizes Git repositories as submodules, allowing for version control and collaborative evolution of ideas.
- **Web-Based Interface**: Accessible through any modern web browser, hosted on GitHub Pages.
- **Relational Organization**: Knowledge is structured based on connections between ideas (Dreams) and people (Dreamers).
- **Holonic Organization**: Facilitates the self-organization of knowledge into a coherent holarchy of ideas using git submodule functionality.
- **Visual Representation**: Utilizes React Three Fiber for immersive 3D visualization of the knowledge network.

## Technical Implementation

- **Frontend**: React-based web application with React Three Fiber for 3D visualizations.
- **Backend**: Static site hosted on GitHub Pages, utilizing Git submodules for content management.
- **Data Structure**: JSON file describing the DreamVault structure, generated and updated through GitHub Actions.

## Getting Started

1. Visit the Dream Explorer [website](https://projectliminality.github.io/DreamExplorer/)
2. Navigate through the 3D space to explore different Dream Nodes.
3. Click on nodes to view Dream Talks (thumbnails) and flip them around to access Dream Songs (README files).
4. Use the semantic search functionality to find specific Dreams or Dreamers.

## Contributing
